<h2>Greetings honored guests! Today, I-your gracious, generous (and slightly dramatic) host- am opening
    doors to a celebration of sugar, whimsy, and questionable authority. <br> There is only <i>one</i> rule here.
    Well... actually... there are several. But they all revolve around cake.</h2>

<div id="rules">
    <h3>Rule No.1</h3>I will call each gust forward according to age. One bye one. Patiently. Magestically. When your
    age is spoken, you must answer correctly.<br>
    <h3>Rule No.2</h3>The correct response? Simply: <b>"Let them eat cake."</b><br>Exactly that. No more. No less. No
    add-ons, emojies, or even nervous giggles.<br>
    <h3>Rule No.3</h3>Upon perfect recitation, you shall recieve your slice-a fluffy symbol of triumph, etiquette, and
    delicious compliance.<br>
    <h3>Rule No. 4</h3>Failure to respond with the sacred phrase results in-<i>gasps</i><br>no cake for you!<h3>Rule
        No.5</h3>Attempts to bribe the host will be met with admiration(but will not get you cake).<br>Probably<br>We'll
    see.
